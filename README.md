# HtmlConverter
This program allows you to create custom signs to complete complicated divs
```html
Basic syntax for your mid file:
* <- Required to start the autocompletion
! <- Special character to call later in the program
<div id="Anything">
  <div id="HoweverManyYouWant">
    ! <- Use the character from earlier, this is where your code will go
  </div>
</div>
* <- Use this to end

From the actual application:
! Anything you want here will go inside the code you wrote earlier
! You can call this again and again
```
